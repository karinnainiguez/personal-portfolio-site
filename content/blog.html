            <h1>The History Of Paint</h1>
            <date>April 10, 2003</date>

              <p>Let the paint work. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. This is the fun part Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. We don't have anything but happy trees here.</p>
              <p>I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. In this world, everything can be happy. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen.</p>
              <p>With practice comes confidence. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. That's crazy. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. This is gonna be a happy little seascape.</p>

              <p>Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. A happy cloud. The least little bit can do so much.</p>
              <p>That's crazy. Take your time. Speed will come later. We'll have a super time. Working it up and down, back and forth. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here.</p>
              <p>They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. See there, told you that would be easy. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here.</p>
              <p>Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important.</p>

            <h1>The Worst Advice We've Ever Heard About Paint</h1>
            <date>May 6, 2013</date>
            <p>Nicky Buchanan</p>
            <section>
              <p>Just beat the devil out of it. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. Let's have a happy little tree in here. Work that paint. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Let your imagination be your guide. We need dark in order to show light. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush.</p>
              <p>Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Let's have a little bit of fun today. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen.</p>
              <p>Trees grow however makes them happy. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. In your world you have total and absolute power. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Just use the old one inch brush. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun.</p>
              <p>Let's get crazy. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. A beautiful little sunset. At home you have unlimited time. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens.</p>
              <p>I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.</p>
              <p>Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Just make little strokes like that. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. Let all these things just sort of happen. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. Don't fight it, use what happens.</p>
              <p>The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Here we're limited by the time we have. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. The light is your friend. Preserve it. Be brave. There are no limits in this world. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.</p>

              <p>You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. This is your world. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Just make little strokes like that.</p>
              <p>Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens.</p>
              <p>We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. See there, told you that would be easy. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown.</p>
              <p>Let's have a happy little tree in here. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here.</p>
              <p>You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. We'll make some happy little bushes here.</p>

              <p>Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown.</p>
              <p>I get carried away with this brush cleaning. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow.</p>
              <p>I like to beat the brush. Just make a decision and let it go. There we go. I thought today we would do a happy little picture.</p>
              <p>I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. All kinds of happy little splashes.</p>

            <h1>3 Little-Known Factors That Could Affect Your Painting</h1>

              <p>We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend.</p>
              <p>It's cold, but it's beautiful. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown.</p>
              <p>Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Use what you see, don't plan it. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. You have to make those little noises or it won't work.</p>

              <p>If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Let's do it again then, what the heck. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.</p>
              <p>Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Let's have a happy little tree in here. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner.</p>
              <p>As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.</p>
              <p>This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen.</p>
