      <p>Poor old tree. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things We need dark in order to show light.</p>

      <p>This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Be brave. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. And right there you got an almighty cloud.</p>

        Some Awesome Quotes
      </h1>
      <h2>
        Bob Ross is full of wisdom
      </h2>
      <p>
        Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Trees grow however makes them happy. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. We wash our brush with odorless thinner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. This is your world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. This is unplanned it really just happens. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to beat the brush. Do an almighty painting with us. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important.
